# Coordinator
Coordinator code for a gesture controlled RC robot with a robotic arm
Coordinator code for gesture controlled RC robot with robotic arm. The code was made specifically for two Arduino Unos 
communicating over XBee S2s. The coordinator code takes the values sent from the router Arduino and uses them
to power two motors and determine the direction they spin. The coordinator also uses the value to determine the angle that
is written to the claw/joint.
